/**
 * An *action* is a plain object that represents an intention to change the
 * state. Actions are the only way to get data into the store. Any data,
 * whether from UI events, network callbacks, or other sources such as
 * WebSockets needs to eventually be dispatched as actions.
 *
 * Actions must have a `type` field that indicates the type of action being
 * performed. Types can be defined as constants and imported from another
 * module. It's better to use strings for `type` than Symbols because strings
 * are serializable.
 *
 * Other than `type`, the structure of an action object is really up to you.
 * If you're interested, check out Flux Standard Action for recommendations on
 * how actions should be constructed.
 *
 * @template T the type of the action's `type` tag.
